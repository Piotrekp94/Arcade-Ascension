*

## Current Focus

*   Core Gameplay Implementation: Pure Breakout mechanics with paddle movement, ball physics, and block destruction (upgrade system removed).

## Recent Changes

*   **MAJOR**: Complete removal of upgrade system per user request (2025-08-29)
*   Simplified to pure Breakout/Arkanoid gameplay mechanics
*   GameManager: Removed currency system, now only tracks score
*   PlayerPaddle: Removed upgrade methods, fixed speed at 5f
*   Ball: Removed upgrade methods, fixed speed at 5f  
*   UI: Removed upgrade menu and currency display components
*   Tests: Updated to remove currency/upgrade test cases

## Current Implementation Status

*   **GameManager**: ✅ Complete - Singleton pattern, game state management, score-only system
*   **PlayerPaddle**: ✅ Complete - Input handling (WASD/Arrow keys), boundary clamping
*   **Ball**: ✅ Complete - Launch mechanics with fixed speed, physics-based movement
*   **Block**: ✅ Complete - Hit points system, destruction awards 10 score points
*   **UI System**: ✅ Score display working, upgrade system removed
*   **Audio**: ❓ AudioManager exists but integration status unknown

## Open Questions/Issues

*   Ball-block collision detection and physics refinement
*   Game over conditions (all blocks destroyed, ball lost)
*   Audio system integration and sound effects  
*   Level progression and difficulty scaling
*   Win/lose game state transitions
*   Ball physics improvements (spin, angle control)

## Next Development Priorities

1. Implement ball-block collision detection and destruction
2. Add game over/win conditions and state transitions
3. Integrate audio system with game events (ball hit, block destroy)
4. Create level system with multiple block layouts
5. Add particle effects and visual polish
6. Implement ball physics improvements
