This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.
2025-08-29 - Updated to reflect current implementation status after major boundary system and respawn feature development.

## Current Focus

*   **Complete Breakout Game**: Fully functional boundary system, ball respawn mechanics, and manual game control with comprehensive test coverage.

## Recent Major Changes (2025-08-29)

*   **MAJOR**: Implemented complete boundary system with walls and death zone
*   **MAJOR**: Added ball respawn system with configurable timer and paddle attachment
*   **MAJOR**: Manual game control with Start/Restart buttons via GameUIManager
*   **MAJOR**: Comprehensive test suite with TDD approach covering all components
*   **MAJOR**: Fixed all failing tests to align with respawn system behavior

## Current Implementation Status

*   **GameManager**: ✅ Complete - Singleton, game states, score system, ball spawning, respawn timer system
*   **PlayerPaddle**: ✅ Complete - Input handling, ball attachment/launch, boundary clamping
*   **Ball**: ✅ Complete - Physics movement, attachment state, launch mechanics, wall collision
*   **Block**: ✅ Complete - Hit points system, destruction awards points
*   **Boundary System**: ✅ Complete - Wall components (Top/Left/Right), DeathZone (Bottom)
*   **GameUIManager**: ✅ Complete - Manual game control, Start/Restart buttons, UI state management
*   **Respawn System**: ✅ Complete - Configurable timer, paddle attachment, left-click launch
*   **Test Coverage**: ✅ Complete - Comprehensive unit and integration tests for all systems
*   **Audio**: ❓ AudioManager exists but integration status unknown

## Key Features Implemented

*   Ball bounces off top, left, and right walls
*   Ball loss at bottom triggers respawn system (during Playing state)
*   Manual game start/restart via UI buttons
*   Ball spawns attached to paddle, launches with left-click
*   Configurable respawn delay (3 seconds default)
*   Random launch angle variance (±30°) for gameplay variety
*   Complete TDD test coverage with both unit and integration tests

## Current Game Flow

1. **Start State**: Game begins, UI shows Start button
2. **Manual Start**: User clicks Start button → spawns ball attached to paddle → enters Playing state
3. **Gameplay**: Ball launches on left-click, bounces off walls, destroys blocks
4. **Ball Loss**: Ball hits DeathZone → respawn timer starts (stays in Playing state)
5. **Respawn**: After delay → new ball spawns attached to paddle
6. **Game Over**: Manual transition or future win/lose conditions
7. **Restart**: User clicks Restart → resets score and starts new game

## Open Questions/Issues

*   Audio system integration and sound effects
*   Win condition implementation (all blocks destroyed)  
*   Level progression and difficulty scaling
*   Visual polish and particle effects
*   Performance optimization
