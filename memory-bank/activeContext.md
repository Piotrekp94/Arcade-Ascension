## Current Focus

*   Core Gameplay Implementation: Paddle movement, ball physics, block destruction, and basic upgrade system integration.

## Recent Changes

*   Initial implementation of `GameManager`, `PlayerPaddle`, `Ball`, `Block`, and `UpgradeManager` scripts.
*   Basic UI for score and currency display with TextMeshPro.
*   PlayerPaddle: Keyboard input handling (WASD/Arrow keys), speed and size upgrade support.
*   Ball: Physics-based movement, speed adjustment capabilities.
*   UpgradeManager: Basic upgrade system with PaddleSpeed, PaddleSize, BallSpeed types implemented.

## Current Implementation Status

*   **GameManager**: ✅ Complete - Singleton pattern, game state management, score/currency system
*   **PlayerPaddle**: ✅ Complete - Input handling, boundary clamping, upgrade integration  
*   **Ball**: ✅ Basic implementation - Launch mechanics, speed control (needs collision refinement)
*   **UpgradeManager**: ⚠️ Partially complete - Basic upgrades work, MultiBall/ExtraLife need implementation
*   **Block**: ❓ Status unknown - Need to examine implementation
*   **UI System**: ⚠️ Basic score/currency display working, upgrade menu UI needed
*   **Audio**: ❓ AudioManager exists but integration status unknown

## Open Questions/Issues

*   Complete MultiBall and ExtraLife upgrade implementations
*   Block destruction mechanics and collision handling
*   Upgrade menu UI integration and user interaction
*   Audio system integration and sound effects
*   Game balancing and difficulty progression
*   Comprehensive unit and integration testing implementation

## Next Development Priorities

1. Complete Block implementation and collision system
2. Implement MultiBall and ExtraLife upgrade effects  
3. Create upgrade menu UI system
4. Integrate audio system with game events
5. Add game state transitions and win/lose conditions
