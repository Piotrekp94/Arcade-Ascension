*   **LevelManager**: ✅ Complete - Singleton, level data management, progression logic, unlock system
*   **LevelSelectionUI**: ✅ Complete - Level button grid, lock/unlock states, level selection events
*   **LevelSelectionIntegrator**: ✅ Complete - Unity Editor integration, level data binding
*   **Level System**: ✅ Complete - 10 ScriptableObject level data assets with progressive difficulty, sprite lists, separate X/Y spacing
*   **Boundary System**: ✅ Complete - Wall components (Top/Left/Right), DeathZone (Bottom)
*   **GameUIManager**: ✅ Complete - Level selection flow, UI state management, game control
*   **Respawn System**: ✅ Complete - Configurable timer, paddle attachment, left-click launch
*   **Test Coverage**: ✅ Complete - Comprehensive TDD coverage for ALL systems including level progression
*   **Audio**: ❓ AudioManager exists but integration status unknown

## Key Features Implemented

*   **Level Progression**: 10 levels with sequential unlock system (Level 1 unlocked by default)
*   **Level Selection UI**: Interactive button grid showing locked/unlocked states
*   **Dynamic Block Spawning**: Level-specific block configurations (rows, columns, separate X/Y spacing)
*   **Random Block Sprites**: Each block randomly selects from level-specific sprite collections
*   **Level Completion**: Automatic detection when all blocks destroyed, unlocks next level
*   **Configurable Difficulty**: Progressive difficulty scaling through level parameters
*   **Unity Editor Integration**: ScriptableObject-based level data for easy designer modification
*   **Ball Physics**: Bounces off walls, triggers respawn system at bottom
*   **Player Flow**: Level Selection → Playing → Level Completion → Return to Level Selection
*   **Manual Controls**: Level selection via UI, ball launch with left-click
*   **Comprehensive TDD**: Complete test coverage for all level system components

## Current Game Flow

1. **Start State**: Game begins, UI shows Level Selection panel
2. **Level Selection**: User chooses from unlocked levels (Level 1 available by default)
3. **Level Start**: Selected level loads with specific block configuration, ball spawns attached to paddle
4. **Gameplay**: Ball launches on left-click, bounces off walls, destroys blocks
5. **Ball Loss**: Ball hits DeathZone → respawn timer starts (stays in Playing state)
6. **Respawn**: After delay → new ball spawns attached to paddle (continues current level)
7. **Level Completion**: All blocks destroyed → next level unlocked → return to Level Selection
8. **Level Progression**: Player selects newly unlocked levels to continue progression

## Open Questions/Issues

*   Audio system integration and sound effects
*   Win condition implementation (all blocks destroyed)  
*   Level progression and difficulty scaling
*   Visual polish and particle effects
*   Performance optimization
