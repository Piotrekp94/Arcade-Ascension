2025-08-29 - Updated to reflect completed boundary system and respawn mechanics implementation.

## Completed Tasks

*   Discussion and documentation of unit test approach (2025-08-28)
*   GameManager implementation with singleton pattern, game states, score system (2025-08-29)
*   PlayerPaddle implementation with input handling, boundaries (2025-08-29)  
*   Ball implementation with physics movement and fixed speed (2025-08-29)
*   Block implementation with hit points and score rewards (2025-08-29)
*   Basic UI integration for score display using TextMeshPro (2025-08-29)
*   **MAJOR**: Complete upgrade system removal per user request (2025-08-29)
*   **MAJOR**: Complete boundary system implementation (2025-08-29)
    - Wall components for Top, Left, Right boundaries with bouncing physics
    - DeathZone component for bottom boundary with ball loss detection
    - Physics materials for proper ball bouncing behavior
*   **MAJOR**: Ball respawn system with configurable timer (2025-08-29)
    - Configurable respawn delay (3 seconds default)
    - Ball spawns attached to paddle after loss
    - Left-click launch mechanism with random angle variance (±30°)
    - Respawn only during Playing state (not Start/GameOver)
*   **MAJOR**: Manual game control system via GameUIManager (2025-08-29)
    - Start button to begin game and spawn initial ball
    - Restart button to reset game and start fresh
    - UI state management for different game phases
*   **MAJOR**: Comprehensive test coverage with TDD approach (2025-08-29)
    - Unit tests for all core components (GameManager, PlayerPaddle, Ball, DeathZone, Wall)
    - Integration tests for boundary system interactions
    - Test fixes for respawn system behavior alignment
    - Deterministic testing methods for reliable test results
*   **MAJOR**: Complete Level Selection System Implementation (2025-08-31)
    - LevelManager singleton with level progression logic and unlock system
    - LevelSelectionUI with interactive button grid and lock/unlock states  
    - BlockManager with configurable block spawning per level
    - 10 ScriptableObject level data assets with progressive difficulty scaling
    - Level completion detection and automatic next level unlocking
    - Unity Editor integration with LevelSelectionIntegrator
    - Comprehensive TDD test coverage for all level system components
    - Complete player flow: Level Selection → Playing → Level Completion → Return to Selection

## Current Tasks

*   **PHASE COMPLETE**: Full Level Selection System with 10-level progression ✅
*   All major game systems implemented and tested with comprehensive TDD coverage

## Next Development Phase Options

*   **Audio Integration**: Sound effects for ball hits, block destruction, game events, level completion
*   **Visual Polish**: Particle effects, animations, visual feedback for level completion
*   **Advanced Level Features**: Different block types, special obstacles, power-ups per level
*   **Persistence System**: Save/load unlocked levels and player progress
*   **Performance Optimization**: Code cleanup and optimization
*   **Enhanced UI**: Level previews, completion statistics, difficulty indicators
*   **Additional Features**: Multiple lives, time challenges, score leaderboards

## Technical Achievements

*   **Test-Driven Development**: Strict TDD approach with RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles
*   **Clean Architecture**: Component-based design with clear separation of concerns
*   **Event-Driven Systems**: Proper event handling between components
*   **Unity Best Practices**: Singleton patterns, proper MonoBehaviour lifecycle management
*   **Comprehensive Testing**: Both unit and integration test coverage
*   **Git Best Practices**: Proper commit messages, branching, and version control
