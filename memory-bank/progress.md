## Current Tasks

*   [2025-08-29] - Phase 1: Pure Breakout Implementation (In Progress)
    - Ball-block collision detection and physics refinement

*   [2025-08-29] - Add game over/win conditions (all blocks destroyed, ball lost)
*   [2025-08-29] - Audio system integration with game events (ball hit, block destroy, game over)
*   [2025-08-29] - Level system with multiple block layouts and progression
*   [2025-08-29] - Ball physics improvements (angle control, spin effects)
*   [2025-08-29] - Visual polish and particle effects
*   [2025-08-29] - Update unit and integration tests for simplified system
