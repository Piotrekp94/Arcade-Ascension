[2025-08-28 17:37:18] - Technical Stack Decision
## Decision
The technical stack for the project will be Unity game engine with C# scripting.

## Rationale
Unity provides a robust and widely-used platform for 2D game development, offering extensive tools for physics, rendering, and scripting. C# is the native scripting language for Unity, ensuring seamless integration and access to the engine's full capabilities. This choice aligns with the project's goal of building a game similar to Pong with an upgrade system, as Unity's component-based architecture is well-suited for managing game objects, player mechanics, and upgrade functionalities.

## Implementation Details
*   Utilize Unity's 2D physics system for ball and paddle interactions.
*   Implement game logic, player controls, scoring, enemy AI, and upgrade mechanics using C# scripts.
*   Leverage Unity's UI system for displaying scores, upgrade menus, and other in-game information.
*   Manage game assets (sprites, sounds) within the Unity editor.
2025-08-28 17:38:41 - Decision: Unit Testing Approach for Arcade Ascension.
Rationale: To ensure code quality, maintainability, and reduce regressions in the Unity game project.
Implementation Details:
- Utilize Unity Test Runner for all unit tests.
- Focus unit tests on core game logic, utility classes, and non-MonoBehaviour components.
- For MonoBehaviour components, test isolated logic where possible, and consider integration/playmode tests for interactions.
- Employ mocking frameworks (e.g., NSubstitute, Moq) for external dependencies to ensure true unit isolation.
- Organize tests in a dedicated 'Tests' folder, mirroring the project's main folder structure.
- Aim for high code coverage, especially for critical game mechanics and upgrade systems.
